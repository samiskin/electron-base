# electron-base
My basic setup for an electron app using react and redux, based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

## Install
Simply run `npm install`

## Run

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
npm run hot-server
npm run start-hot
```
