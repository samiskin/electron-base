# electron-base
My basic setup for an electron app using react and redux, based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

## Install
Simply run `npm install`

## Run

Run `npm run watch` to begin the webpack watching of the browser files as well
as the hot loading of the renderer files. Once the electron files have been
compiled, run `npm start` in a __separate terminal__ to start the app.
